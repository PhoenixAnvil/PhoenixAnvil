# 👋 Welcome to PhoenixAnvil Labs

Hi, I’m **Jason** — a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with 20+ years of experience, a strong manual QA foundation, and a deep interest in modern test engineering, APIs, performance, and CI/CD.

This GitHub profile represents my **hands-on learning and portfolio work**, where I explore modern QA practices through small, focused, real-world projects.

---

## 🧪 What I’m Building

🎯 I’m building a **curated portfolio of QA-focused projects** that demonstrate how I approach quality in modern systems:

- API design and validation
- Functional and regression testing
- Performance and load testing
- CI/CD orchestration
- Cloud-hosted systems

Each project is intentionally scoped, documented, and tested — emphasizing **clarity, correctness, and real-world workflows**, not tutorial code.

---

## 🧰 Current Portfolio Highlights

### 🔹 Demo API (SUT)
- **Python + FastAPI**
- Publicly hosted on **Azure App Service**
- Clean REST design with strict validation
- Designed explicitly to support functional and performance testing

### 🔹 API Functional Testing
- **Python + pytest**
- Validates request/response behavior, status codes, and data integrity
- Structured for CI execution
- Tests executed automatically via GitHub Actions

### 🔹 Performance & Load Testing
- **Grafana k6**
- Smoke and performance checks with thresholds (p95, error rate)
- CI-triggered and scheduled workflows
- Used to understand system behavior, not just chase numbers

### 🔹 CI/CD Orchestration
- **GitHub Actions**
- Event-driven workflows
- Azure deployment followed by automated test orchestration
- Cross-repo workflow coordination

## ⚙️ Core Technologies & Tools

- 🐍 **Python** (FastAPI, pytest)
- 🌐 **REST APIs**, HTTP status codes, request/response validation
- 📊 **Grafana k6** (performance & load testing)
- ☁️ **Azure App Service**
- 🔁 **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD & orchestration)
- 🗃️ **SQL** (data validation & backend verification)
- 🧪 Manual, exploratory, and risk-based testing
- 🧠 AI-assisted development workflows (used responsibly as a productivity multiplier)

---

## 🔍 How I Use AI (Transparently)

I actively explore **AI-assisted workflows** to accelerate:
- test generation
- scaffolding
- exploratory automation

AI helps me move faster — **human judgment owns the strategy, validation, and risk decisions**. Every test and workflow in this portfolio is reviewed, executed, and understood before being kept.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Deepening **API testing and automation** skills
- Strengthening **performance testing fundamentals**
- Building **production-style CI/CD pipelines**
- Improving test reliability, observability, and maintainability
- Preparing for **ISTQB CTFL** (Spring 2025)

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Quality

- ✅ Thoughtful manual testing is foundational
- ✅ Automation supports insight, not checkbox coverage
- ✅ Fast feedback beats perfect tooling
- ✅ Real systems > toy examples
- ✅ Continuous learning is part of the job
